Adonis Code Review

The purpose of this session is to work in groups to use adonis in the R package vegan to compare the microbial community structures of various groups using PERMANOVA. We will go over the data tables and functions that will be used together. 

By the end of this code reivew you will be able to do basic analyses with adonis in vegan.

Time breakdown:

10 mins of review of needed material
20 mins of coding
20 mins of discussion of results

You should have these in your pulled repo:

metadata.codereview.txt
example.thetayc.0.03.lt.ave.dist

Goals:

Run an adonis comparing clinical metadata to the microbiome (excluding Response, Remission, and TRTGR) without looking for interacitons.

Run an adonis looking for interactions between age, sex, and disease duration.
